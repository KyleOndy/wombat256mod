The [Wombat256mod](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2465) vim theme packaged for [pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) and by extension [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim).

To use:
add the folowing to your .vimrc

    NeoBundle "KyleOndy/wombat256mod"
    colors wombat256mod 

You will also need to set your term to support 256 colors. I use xterm-256color.

    export TERM=xterm-256color
